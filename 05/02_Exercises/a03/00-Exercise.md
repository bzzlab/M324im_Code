### Exercise 3: Code coverage for Traffic light API with JEST
###  Prerequisite
1. NodeJS is installed.
### Task 1: Create code coverage report in the browser 
1. Set up the app (src-directory) with the required node packages
2. Change index.js in order test it without start it as a separate server.
3. In order to obtain more detail on the uncovered code,
   run the code coverage test with a web report and analyze it.
4. Write suitable unit tests in order to cover more code. Check your
   improvements. As a goal you should come near (or better) to the result below.
``` 
 PASS  tests/trafficlight.test.js
  GET /api/welcome
    √ welcome message (27 ms)
  GET /api/trafficlight
    √ out of order (4 ms)
  GET /api/trafficlight/:color
    √ When color is  then "OUT OF ORDER" (3 ms)
    √ When color is green then WALK! (3 ms)
    √ When color is orange then "ATTENTION!" (3 ms)
    √ When color is red then "DON'T WALK!" (2 ms)

```
5. Test the app with ```null``` and empty string. If your unit tests fail, the 
change ```trafficlight.js``` in order to cover these cases too.
